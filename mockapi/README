The mock API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Endpoints

The mock API provides the following endpoints:

- `/links`: Represents links with associated metadata.
- `/users`: Represents user accounts with authentication information.
- `/clicks`: Represents click events with related data.

## Data Model

The mock API uses the following data model:

- **Links**: Represents shortened URLs with metadata.
- **Users**: Represents user accounts with authentication details.
- **Clicks**: Represents click events with associated information.

The `db.json` file contains predefined data for these models.

## Usage

You can interact with the mock API using HTTP requests, just like with a real API. Use tools like cURL, Postman, or your favorite HTTP client to send requests to the defined endpoints.

For example, to retrieve all links, you can send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/links`.
